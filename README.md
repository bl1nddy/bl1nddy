Hi! I'm **@bl1nddy** ! I like programming so much, I started this activity in 2022. 
Programming languages I want to study:
  - C/C++ - because it's ***useful***
  - GoLang - because of *high performance* and simplicity
For now, i can code only in Python, but i worked with many modules.
Also, I can draw sprites/locations for games. 

My favorite colours is:
  - Blue-violet `#8A2BE2`
  - Grape `#6F2DA8`
  - Tekhelet `#512888`
  - Black `#000000`
  - White `#FFFFFF`
  - Dark violet `#9400D3`

I speak this languages:
  1) English - B1 level - `I think that I will study it until the grave...`
  2) Russian - C2 level - `By the way, I'm a native speaker!`

You can contact me in:
  - Discord (same username) `that's all for now`
